    <h1>Getting Started with the Baomao Programming Language</h1>
    <h3><i>By Michael Yuhas</i></h3>
    <hr />
    <h2>I. Installation</h2>
    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p>1.) In your "C:\Program Files" Directory create a folder called "Baomao".</p>
    <img src='windows_step1.png' />
    <p>2.) Open control panel and search for 'path'.  Press 'Edit environment variables for your account'.  In the window that appears, select the Path variable and press 'Edit'.  Press 'New' and enter C:\Program Files\Baomao.  Press okay and save changes.</p>

    <p>3.) Copy baomao.exe from cpl\bin\x86\windows10\baomao.exe into C:\Program Files\Baomao\baomao.exe</p>
    <p>4.) Open terminal and type 'baomao'.  You should see the following appear:

    <h3>Linux and MacOS</h3>
    <p>1.) Open terminal and copy the baomao binary file into the /usr/bin directory:<pre>sudo cp ~/git/cpl/bin/x86/linux/baomao /usr/local/bin/</pre></p>
    <p>2.) Type 'baomao' and try to run the program.  You should see the following appear:</p>

    <h2>II. Install and IDE</h2>
    <p>You can use your favorite text editor or IDE to create Baomao programs, but I recommend using Atom.  I have created an atom package that includes syntax highlighting to make reading and writing code easier.  This section details the installation process.</p>
    <p>1.) Download and install Atom on your system.  Go to https://atom.io</p>
    <p>2.) Clone my baomao language package for Atom:<pre>git clone https://github.com/m-yuhas/language-baomao.git</pre></p>
    <p>3.) Copy the language package into the .atom folder for you Atom installation.  Terminal commands are listed below, but you can do this using the GUI if that is more comfortable.  On Linux and MacOS:<pre>cp -r cp -r ~/git/language-baomao/ ~/.atom/packages/language-baomao/</pre>On Windows:<pre>mkdir .atom\packages\language-baomao<br />xcopy git\language-baomao .atom\packages\language-baomao /s /e</pre></p>
    <h2>III. Hello World</h2>
    <p>Let's create a basic program to test everything.  Open up your favorite IDE and create a file with the following line:<pre>输出（“你好时节！”）</pre>Save the file as 'hello.bm'.  If you are using Atom and have the language package installed you should now see 输出 appear in blue.  To run open terminal and type:<pre>baomao hello.bm</pre>You should see the following output:</p>

    <h2>IV. Getting User Input</h2>
    <p>Now let's make a program that get's user input.  We can do this with the 输入 function. 输入 will display a string in the console and collect all user input before the return key is pressed.  This data will be stored as a string.  Try it with the example program below:<pre>姓名 《 输入（“你叫什么名字？”）<br />输出（“你好”+姓名）</pre>Notice also that we can use the '+' operator on two strings to concatenate them. Notice also that we can set a variable using '《'.  Instead of using '=' to set a variable like in other programming language, an arrow (《) is used to show that the result of the expression on the right is being stored into the variable on the left.  This helps students learning programming reinforce the fact that a variable acts as a storage container for a value.</p>

    <h2>V. Branching</h2>
    <p>We also have the ability to branch depending on a condition.  See the example code below:<pre>姓名 《 输入（“你叫什么名字？”）<br />如果 姓名 = “我不知道”<br />&emsp;输出（“你怎么不知道你的名字？“）<br />否则<br />&emsp;输出（”你好“+姓名）<br />结束分支</pre>In this case 如果 asks if the following condition is true or false.  If the condition after 如果 is true, the commands immediately following the line with 如果 are executed.  If the condition is false, the lines after 否则 are executed.  After the 结束分支 statement, every line is executed regardless of the previous condition.  Thus in this example the user is asked what their name is.  If they reply that they do not know, then the program chastizes them.  Otherwise, it greets them.</p>
    <h2>VI. Looping</h2>
    Okay, let's do something a little more mathematical; let's calculate the Fibonacci sequence.  We can do this with a loop:<pre>斐波那契数号 《 1<br />以前来的数号 《 1<br />当 斐波那契数号 小于 1000<br />&emsp;输出（斐波那契数号）<br />&emsp;暂时价值 《 斐波那契数号<br />&emsp;斐波那契数号 《 斐波那契数号 + 以前来的数号<br />&emsp;以前来的数号 《 暂时价值<br />结束循环</pre>In this example when the statement after 当 evaluates to true, all the statements between 当 and 结束循环 are executed.  After execution completes, the statement after 当 is evaluated again and the process continues.
    <h2>VII. Recursion</h2>
    You can also calculate the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.  In Baomao language this is possible by defining a function and then calling it recursively.  We can define a function using the keyword 函数 followed by the function name.  After, 要 is used to show which arguments the function takes.  See the example code below for the function 斐波那脆, which takes arguments 目前 and 以前 corresponding to the current and previous Fibonacci numbers.  To indicate the end of a function, use the keyword 结束函数.  The code inside the function will not be executed until the function is called.  You call the function by using its name followed by the list of arguments separated by commas, contained within parentheses.  Furthermore, the keyword 返回 can be used at anytime to escape execution of the function:<pre>函数 斐波那脆 要 目前、以前<br />&emsp;输出（目前）<br />&emsp;如果 目前 大于 1000<br />&emsp;&emsp;返回<br />&emsp;否则<br />&emsp;&emsp;暂时 《 目前<br />&emsp;&emsp;目前 《 以前 + 目前<br />&emsp;&emsp;以前 《 暂时<br />&emsp;&emsp;斐波那脆（目前、以前）<br />&emsp;&emsp;返回<br /> &emsp;结束分支<br />结束函数<br /><br />斐波那脆（1、1）</pre>
